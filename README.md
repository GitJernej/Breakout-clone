# Breakout-clone
My personal project for diploma thesis.

Created with gradle using the libGDX framework.

Open the Brick Game folder as an existing project. with the necessary libgdx plugins.

Bricks.jar - is just a rough version of the main gameplay.
Bricks-v0.0.jar - this one has a semi-working menu

to-do list: 
- win conditions/game-over event
- increase ball speed according to blocks that are left to be destroyed
- a way to select a level
- sound effects
- options menu
- screen transitions
- polish and such....
